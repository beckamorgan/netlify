<!--li><p><strong>Use the project on Pivotal Tracker given to you to coordinate our Scrum activities.</strong>  Important things to remember:</p>
							
                            <ul>
                                <li>Customize the Project Settings before you begin adding stories.  Details such as Initial Velcocity and Point Scale to use will be covered in class.</li>
                                <li>Make sure all team members have full access and everyone has uploaded an image or avatar so they're easily identified.</li>
                                <li>Add a project description on the Profile page.  Your Git repository will contain a much more complete description of your project, but we want something here too.</li>
                            </ul> </li-->
                            <li><p><strong>Populate your Product Backlog</strong></p><p><a href="CS461_story_state_diagram.svg" class="pull-right"><img src="CS461_story_state_diagram.svg" alt="State diagram of user stories" width="400"></a></p><p>  Go over your user stories and epics for the class project that you identified during the inception phase last week.  Which ones are really Epics? Or just User Stories?  Organize and then enter all of them into your product backlog.  Do the following</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Everything you currently have (from your initial requirements and modeling phase, not just for sprint 1) should go in your backlog.</li>
                                    <li>Priority is established by the order items appear; items at the top have the highest priority</li>
                                    <li>Use Epics for most stories.  Typically every user story is bigger than you think, especially now when everything is new.  You only need to break down the highest priority one and only if it or user stories from it might be added to the current iteration.</li>
                                    <li>Using Tasks is up to you. It is recommended to use tasks early on to get a feel for planning what it will take to finish your user story. But since our product backlog template is a simple table, leave out tasks in that document for now.  Just write yourself a todo list for tasks if you like.</li>
                                    <li>Descriptions are required for stories in your current iteration.  Put in a summary of everything you've discussed about that story; links to modeling artifacts (in your repo); images; drawings, ...</li>
                                    <li>Normally we'd assign effort points for the highest priority backlog items but let's wait on that until we have a better idea of effort itself.  Estimating effort is hard and requires experience.  <!--Don't try to estimate epics, only user stories--></li>
                                </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><p><strong>Sprint 1 Planning: Iteration planning, backlog grooming and refinement</strong></p>
                                        
                                        <p>Try to follow the DAD book's process for Iteration Planning on page 292, Chapter 14.  <em>As a team</em> you are doing Just-In-Time planning and modeling of a solution for PBI's and tasks to be committed into the Sprint. Hold a Sprint Planning Meeting and groom the class project product backlog.  If you have 4 small user stories near the top, use them.  If not, refine your backlog until you do have 4 nice small user stories at the top to use for this sprint.  It should already be in priority order (at least to your current knowledge). Add a single user story to Sprint 1 for each team member and set them as the Owner.  This is a mini-iteration used for practice and will have the purpose of setting up a relatively simple version of the class project.</p><p>Since this is just a simple version you may need to be a little creative with your user stories for this one.  We don't want the construction to be difficult or time consuming on this one: let's say 1.5-3 hours max per person for the entire sprint.  No real features yet.  That's OK.  The purpose of this is to run through the process.  Next week we'll do some real features.  You may want to additionally break things down into Tasks, which don't have to be written in user story format.  For this first Sprint try to keep things simple so that each user story has only one owner.  The owner is responsible for that story. </p><!--p>Make sure the instructor or your project advisor goes over your Sprint 1 backlog before you start working to check it over and make sure it is correct.</p--></li>

                                            Run through this Sprint and create a very simple initial version of the application.  At the end of the sprint for the Sprint Review meeting, it must be deployed on Azure and have some database interaction.  The database should be deployed on Azure.  Make sure you go through the whole process, updating the product backlog as you go and conclude the Sprint.  <!--Every team member must manage their own user story in Pivotal Tracker; don't ever modify user stories if you're not the owner of it.-->  When you are finished with it, and it's tested and working, mark it as Finished.  It will only be Accepted and Delivered after your Sprint Review meeting and after it is merged into the main branch.  There's a state diagram image (above) to help explain our workflow.</p>
                                            <p>  Create new feature branches off dev for all work and submit them using pull requests (PR) using our Git workflow.  The repository owner/maintainer only merges dev into master after the Sprint Review meeting and only for stories that were accepted. (We'll go over this workflow and the one for when certain PR's aren't accepted -- see figure at right.)  The maintainer can move stories to Delivered at this point. It is best to have a separate testing site deployed on Azure off dev that you can put up and take down at any time.  We'll use that one to demo all your work at the Sprint Review meeting.  Once you have Sprint 1 completed and have accepted and delivered work in your master branch you can expect to have your main site deployed all the time (the one deployed off master).

                                    <li><p><strong>Team Project (1 of 3 weeks)</strong></p>  <p>Select one of your ideas and go with it (assuming it's approved by your advisor).  This will be the first pass at an Inception phase.  Spend quality time with your group going through the first parts of Inception.  You want to determine a really good overall vision for your project.  Follow the roadmap from the class project.  First create a Mindmap or other brainstorming diagrams that outline what you think your project will entail.  Then write an initial description of your project vision.  Then move on to a preliminary list of Needs and Features and possibly some requirements.  Keep all these in your official team repo in plain text files (i.e. Markdown files are good) when possible.  Be prepared to discuss the details of your work with your Advisor, especially the needs and features.  In fact, give a little pitch of your idea and the details.  There will be questions!</p></li>
