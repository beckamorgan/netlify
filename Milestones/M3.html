                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Vision Statement &#9654; </strong> It's likely that your ideas for the project have changed since last week when you wrote your first draft of a vision statement. Take a moment now to revise it based on new information.
                                It can deviate from the template and can get longer. Let's just keep it to less than a page in length. <em>Note: don't do it in a new document; rather, make edits to the previous one and let Git track those changes for you.  That way an observer can see what changes you made to the statement over time. --If that means rearranging the folders in your repo, please do so.</em></p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Stakeholders and Personas &#9654; </strong> Identify all the possible stakeholders you can think of, both real and imaginary: clients, developers, advisors, outside experts, sponsors, users, ... Give a short explanation
                                about why they are a stakeholder and what role they play in your project. If possible, identify an actual person, by name. </p>
                            <p>For your future users, create 3 personas. Give them each an actual (ficticious and random) name, home town, job, and other useful background information including a photo. Take this as an opportunity to add diversity to your
                                user base. You should strive to have each persona be fundamentally different, but still a realistic user of your application. It would be a good idea to use ChatGPT here for generating backstories for your personas, as
                                well as a AI face generator for the image. Here are some resources on the concept of a "persona": </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> <a href="http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/personas.htm">Personas: An Agile Introduction</a> </li>
                                <li> <a href="https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/personas.html">usability.gov: Personas</a></li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>And if you haven't guessed by now, put these in a markdown file (yes, you can have images in markdown -- it's just converted to HTML anyway), or just an actual HTML file.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Timeline and Release Plan &#9654; </strong> If you didn't do this last week, do it now. We know all the key dates and events all the way out to the end of Spring term: 4 1-week milestones followed by 3 2-week sprints
                                during Winter term, then 5 2-week sprints during Spring. Academic Excellence Showcase will be the final key delivery date (last year it was on Thursday of week 9). Sprint 8 is usually a bug-fix, documentation, maintenance
                                sprint, but it is a real sprint. And another hint: how about an HTML file for this one? Tables are easy in HTML. </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Needs &amp; Features &#9654; </strong> Update your needs and features list with any new information you have developed.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Requirements E &amp; E &#9654; </strong> Go through the Requirements exercise using the provided template to try to elicit, elaborate, and analyze your top level, top priority, and otherwise overall features and needs.
                                You're not trying to do everything for all possible features, but you do want to try to answer the major questions that have arisen and at least get a good idea of what your features will offer and how they'll need to behave.
                                After going through this exercise, your goal is to have enough information to be able to:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>prioritize your top features/epics</li>
                                <li>build an initial data model that will (approximately) support your top priority feature/epic</li>
                                <li>be able to break down your top priority feature into good user stories that follow the INVEST attributes</li>
                                <li>have enough information for stories for Sprint 1 and a couple stories of Sprint 2</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Initial System Architecture &#9654; </strong> Update your architecture diagram with any new information you've developed. Include any external API's and external storage you've identified as well as any major software
                                libraries you'll need to use. You probably have only general needs and haven't identified an actual provider yet, so it's OK to just draw and label it with &ldquo;SMS text provider&rdquo;, for example.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Modeling Outputs &#9654; </strong> Based on what you've identified so far, spend some time doing various initial modeling exercises. Here are some that are likely appropriate now:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Use Case modeling: draw up use case diagrams for your top features</li>
                                <li>Initial system architecture: yeah, item 6. above is technically modeling</li>
                                <li>UI modeling: sketch out what your application might look like for your top feature as well as the overall design of your application (i.e. will it have a navbar? top or side? footer? what basic pages will you want to have
                                    eventually? About, contact, map, FAQ, ...)</li>
                                <li>Data modeling (don't try to do too much yet on this one, maybe just a first attempt at identifying entities and their attributes.)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Jira and Epics &#9654; </strong> We need to get started using our agile work management tool. Have one user create a project on <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a>, set it up and invite your teammates.
                                Please also invite your advisor. Take some time reading the getting started docs. We need to start learning how to use this tool to make our sprints, and the whole project, go more smoothly.</p>
                            <p>Once you have a project set up and ready to go, populate your &ldquo;Backlog&rdquo; with all the &ldquo;Epics&rdquo; you have identified. These do not have to be written in user story syntax; in fact, it's easier if you can
                                think of a nice short description for each. Order them by priority, with the highest priority epic at the top. Give them each a different color. In the next milestone you'll tackle breaking down the top one or two epics
                                into good user stories and then create your first sprint.</p>
                        </li>
