                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>This milestone will get your team organized and begin the process of working together as a group. Don't underestimate the difficulty of doing simple things <strong>as a group</strong>. Communicate, communicate, communicate (and Coordinate
                    -- Collaborate -- Conclude)!</p>
                <p>In step 5 you will create a Git repository for your team. This is where all the documents created during each Milestone should be placed (neatly and in appropriate folders). A note on file formats: you should default to plain text files,
                    such as <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a> (<a href="https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/index.html">here's a nice tutorial</a>) or HTML, for everything. The resumes (e.g. Word) and logos, etc.
                    (e.g. png) can and should be in the appropriate formats, but if you're only writing text, put it in a Plain Old Text file. Source repositories, such as Git, are for source code, which means a text file. Of course, html and Markdown
                    are plain text and also give you formatting options if you so desire.</p>
                <p>The &ldquo;3+Branch, with Pull Requests Git Workflow&rdquo; that we'll be using all term isn't formally required until Milestone 2. For now you can either learn the workflow ahead of time, or do the less-than-desired method of manually
                    transferring files to the repo owner, who should add/commit/push them. <strong>Under no circumstances should all team members have admin or write access to the team repository.</strong> That's a great way to screw up your repo. Last
                    term we all had our own repositories and could control the entire push/pull cycles. Imagine 4 people randomly adding, committing, pushing and pulling! </p>
                <div class="questions">
                    <h4>Tasks:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Select a team name (and not only because the one I gave you is so bad). This is how your team will be identified for the next 22 weeks, so give it some thought. Also create a team motto, something short like &ldquo;Success through
                            engineering&rdquo; or <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/11/29/1059821677/google-dont-be-evil-lawsuit">&ldquo;Don't be evil&rdquo;</a>. Create a company logo and an electronic letterhead template that uses it (i.e. for sending
                            official company documents or press releases) for your team. Also prepare electronic business cards or custom email footer images for each member.</li>

                        <li>
                            <p>This section of the milestone will include a resume for each member of the team. <strong>All of the resumes should look the same, contain the same major headings, and have the same format including font size and type, and order of sections.</strong>                                This isn't a common thing to do but we want you to get into the practice of working together with shared documents. It also makes it easier since the design decisions only need to be made once (preferably by your team as
                                a whole).</p>

                            <p>We'll leave it up to your group to decide on the best format, but these must be good ones that you'd be proud to submit with a job application today. There are many, many good resources online for what should go on your resume
                                and what it should look like. One page is best but you can prepare a second one if you wish that has more pages.</p>
                            <p>Don't put your company name or logo on the r&eacute;sum&eacute;; and there is no requirement that you put your actual home address or phone number on it either. Same goes for the business cards or email footer. These will be
                                in a public GitHub repo so you don't have to put sensitive data up there. </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>Create a schedule for your team that lists <strong>five hours of meetings during the week</strong>. Although you will not use all of them, it is good to know they are available during &ldquo;crunch time&rdquo;. There are several
                                specific meetings described in the Scrum tutorials <strong>that are required</strong>! Define some of your schedule times for the five defined Scrum meetings. Standup meetings occur at the beginning of each class, and the
                                scheduled meeting with your team instructor will function as the sprint review meeting. Schedule time for the remaining meetings into your team's weekly schedule. See the Scrum reference card for a quick overview of the
                                meetings.
                            </p>

                            <p>As you'll recall, face-to-face meetings are regarded as the best for agile teams so strive for that. You can use any online meeting software, i.e. Zoom, but you should meet via video for the Scrum defined meetings. <strong>A lack of communication, primarily due to team members not being available for Coordination, Collaboration and Conclusion style meetings, is very high on the list of reasons for poor team performance and low grades.</strong>                                </p>

                            <p>As just mentioned, you will need to schedule a fixed time to meet with your project advisor during the week. As in the real world, you will need to find a time that is convenient for them. Not one that works for your schedule.
                                Your best bets are to look at times that match already scheduled office hours or are next to existing courses.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>Create and set up a nice GitHub repository for your team. This will be the repository for <strong>everything</strong> for your team for the next 22 weeks! Name it appropriately with your team name. The owner of this repository
                                will have additional duties and management oversight of your team's documents and code, including Azure integration. It is probably a good idea for this person to be the same person you might envision as your Team Lead,
                                or the person with the most Git experience. Add a contributors file and a README that describe your team and this project. Add other folders and documents to explain what is going on. It should be easy for me to find all
                                the work for each milestone as well as your source code for the upcoming team project application. A visitor to your repository should be able to tell what this repository is for. Actually, just browse <a href="https://github.com/trending">Trending</a>                                on GitHub and find some project landing pages you like.</p>
                            <p>Have all team members (and your advisor) <strong>fork</strong> the repository and then initialize a local copy (i.e. clone their own fork). We will be going over this process extensively in class.</p>
                            <p><strong>This needs to be a good looking, well organized, and informative repository!</strong></p>
                        </li>

                        <li>Lastly, come up with at least 3 candidate project ideas for your team project. For each one, write a short paragraph description. Where does this document go and what kind of document format should it be in? (In your repo, in a
                            suitable folder, and in markdown.) Be prepared to discuss these in more depth at the meeting with your advisor. Here are some high-level requirements for your team projects:
                            <ul class="setapart-list">
                                <li>Must be based primarily on the architecture we learned last term: ASP.NET Core MVC + SQL Server, both deployed to Azure. You are encouraged to add other resources to this as needed. Some examples: other Azure or AWS services
                                    (i.e. file storage), email (<a href="https://sendgrid.com/">SendGrid</a>), SMS (<a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>).</li>
                                <li>Therefore it will have a public facing web application as its primary feature. Other features you may want to create, such as a mobile app companion or an API you create, must be secondary.</li>
                                <li>Must be something interesting and useful; it should not be boring or routine.</li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Must use an external API for at least one major feature. By external API I mean something like: <a href="https://www.lyft.com/developers">Lyft</a>, <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/developer/">Instagram</a>,
                                        <a href="https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/">Google</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/?csw=1#data_api">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://api.data.gov/">US Government</a>. And I don't mean
                                        something as simple as dropping a Google Map element on your page and calling it good.</p>
                                    <p>Honestly, if you don't use a machine learning API (like one from <a href="https://openai.com/api/">OpenAI</a>) then you'll likely already be falling behind. The rate of development in this arena is exponential at the
                                        moment so catching up with the technology will only get harder the longer you wait.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>At least one major feature must involve an &ldquo;algorithmic component&rdquo; developed by your group.  We'll clarify what this means in class.</li>
                                <li>It's OK to take on a higher risk project. Personally I think it's better to try to do something more interesting and potentially more difficult and accomplish less, than to have a really polished project that's boring and
                                    easy to do. That being said, you need to manage the risk. If your project depends very heavily on X, then you better put a whole bunch of time into learning and figuring out X during the inception phase. If depending
                                    on X forms part of your architecture, you'd better prove it early.</li>
                            </ul>
